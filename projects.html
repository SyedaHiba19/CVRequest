        <h3>1.RFID Based Attendance System</h3><h5>Jan 2020 – Present</h5><br>
            <p>Project description: <br>
            We are making an attendance system in order to replace the manual attendance system. The attendance system that we've made is to help the teachers in various ways such as reducing the time consumed from noting down the attendance in the class to store the data of each and every student in the database manually thereby consuming around 10 to 20 minutes at an approx. for each class. The main concept of the attendance system using RFID is to maintain the attendance record. Each and every student and teacher are allotted with a particular RFID authorized tag/card. The RFID tag/card is put over the RFID reader which reads the unique ID of the particular user which will be send to the database via wifi through nodemcu(comprising of inbuilt wifi) and marks them present and saves the record in a database(sql sheets). The flag/tag/card is the host inside the program to point out the presence of that person. The data stored is displayed on the webpage of mjcet(our college) under the teacher's and student's login. <br>
            <h4>MAIN OBJECTIVES:</h4> <ul>
              <li>Display the attendance related information on the server page of mjcet along with an option for menu button.</li>
              <li>Store and transfer the data of the user ID from Nodemcu to SQL sheets.</li>
              <li>Class starts only when the teacher swipes their card first after which the attendance for the class is validated.</li>
              <li>The access of a student to mark his/her attendance will be denied if they enter a particular class after the allotted time(i.e 30 minutes)
               set.</li>
              <li>Provide an option for clearing data which can be accessed only by the admin using his ID.</li>
              <li>Being used to replace the manual documented system of attendance.</li>
            </ul> <br>

        <h3>2.Spider Bot</h3><h5>Feb 2020 – Present</h5>
            <p>Project description: <br>
            We've made a spider bot, also named as Quadrupedrobot since it is made up of four legs and makes its movements using these legs, the movment of
            each leg is related to the other legs in order to identify the robot like body postion and also to control the robot body balance. Some of the
            functions that our bot performs are moving forward, rotate clockwise and anti-clockwise and moving in left & right direction.
            Legged robots handle terrain better than their wheeled counterparts and move in varied and animalistic ways. However, this makes legged robots
            more complicated, and less accessible to many makers and also the making cost and the high depenses that a maker should spend in order to create
            a full body quadruped since it is based on servo motors or stepper motors and both are more expensive than DC motors that could be used in wheeled
            robots for which our spider bot stands out featuring all the requirements. <br> <br>

        <h3>3.MARS ROVER</h3><h5>Sep 2019</h5>
            <p>Project description : <br>
             We've made a bot which is connected to the Arduino via a bluetooth module, such that it can be controlled using any android device. The Robotic
             Arm helps in collecting the samples and placing them in a particular container. The camera module is connected inside the bot in such a way that
             when it captures the images, it will store those pictures in the SD slot, which can be accessed through any device. As the bot starts moving,
             the camera module has a high resolution thereby giving an image of the pictures captured in motion with clarity. <br>
            <h4>MAIN OBJECTIVE:</h4>
            <ul>
              A Bluetooth Controlled Bot having a Robotic Arm attached to it, in order to collect samples and place it in the required container and the
              Camera module to capture pictures and store it in the SD slot, which can be obtained via Bluetooth module through any device.
