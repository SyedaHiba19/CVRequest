   <h3>Coding</h3>
   <p >Coding - easier to spell, harder to understand and hardest to implement but when you're passionate to get through the hurdles, you win.
      Each day practicing is what gets me afar from where I was before.</p>

   <h3>Binge watching Netflix and Marvel Movies</h3>
   <p>Binge watching of telvision programmes has rapidly increased over years.In what is often labelled as the new 'golden age of television',
      not only have script writers taken up a notch, but full time access to television series has emerged due to websites such as Netflix and
      Amazon Prime. Few of my favourites to binge watch on netflix are friends, YOU and subsequently all marvel cinematic universe movies(mcu). </p>

    <h3>Playing Badminton</h3>
  <p >Playing badminton has not only been a sport to me that helps me refresh my mind but a way to be active and precise. </p>

  <img class="poems_whole" src="poems_whole.png" alt="poems">
  <h3>Writing Poems</h3>
  <p >Writing poems is an art, well that sums up to caling myself an artist. A heavy bound book that has been my
     companion(more likely my phone nowadays) on which I pen down all my thoughts and visionaries. Mir taqi mir remains thy favourite.</p>
</div>


<div class="skill-row">
  <img class="novels_whole" src="novels_whole.png" alt="novels">
  <h3>Novels</h3>
  <p >My way to get through life problems is to catch up on my favourite novels. I have a habit of
     underlining all the essential sentences in each novel, that I go through, which are hard to understand, distinctive to follow and comprehensive to read.
     Most preferred - Nicholas Sparks, John Green. Genre - Romantic, comedy and thriller.  </p>
